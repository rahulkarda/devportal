Reset user 2FA
==============

If you have lost access to your two-factor authenticator for some reason like phone damaged or lost, you will not be able to sign in. However, you can regain access to your account by requesting a password reset from the login screen, and completing password reset steps. This process will also disable two-factor authentication from your account.
If you still have access to the original device and wish to switch to another, you can turn off the 2FA authentication (it requires your password to do that). After that, you can enroll a new device as described in <ANOTHER ARTICLE>.
